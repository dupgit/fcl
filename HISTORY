    This project has been started to cover a hole in the implementation of
    GtkHex. Someone on IRC (on the gnome french channel) told me that I could
    patch it in order to allow it to open files of any sizes but that in any
    cases I had to not break the API. The only way I found is to build a library
    on which GtkHex will rely on. This is supposed to be that library.
    The name of the project is a reference to the FCL Basket Club in Lyon.
