    Can't get anything that please me. Came into a dead end with buffers when
    trying to merge two delete buffers (we have to know which one is the first
    one in time because there is cases where the result might differ)

    Now I'll try to do the documentation in fcl.h and other hearder files if
    any as these are distributed with the library.

    The implemented interfaces are subject to change widely as I'm building
    things as the come to my mind.

    This project has been started to cover a hole in the implementation of
    GtkHex. Someone on IRC (on the gnome french channel) told me that I could
    patch it in order to allow it to open files of any sizes but that in any
    cases I had to not break the API. The only way I found is to build a library
    on which GtkHex will rely on. This is supposed to be that library.
    The name of the project is a reference to the FCL Basket Club in Lyon.
